## About
HRnet is an internal Wealth Health web application that allows you to manage employee records. The goal was to take over the already existing application and migrate the code to a React environment. In addition, we had to move a jQuery library to React.

## How to use
- Go to the right folder :
```shell 
cd hrnet
```
- Install packages :
```shell 
npm install
```
- Run the project with :
```shell 
npm start
```
